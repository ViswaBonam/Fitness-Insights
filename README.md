# Fitness-Insights
Interactive dashboard to better understand the trends in my workout sessions.

# Need for this project
Although I'm not so regular to the gym, I wear a fitness band which keeps track of the activities that I perform. Recently I've decided to take the gym seriously. So the data that my fitness band collected is used to visualize trends in my workout sessions as well as to see room for improvement.

## Data Extraction
The data that is used for this project has been exported from [Mi Band](http://mifit.huami.com/t/account_mifit). 
* The exported data had few ouliers (Times when the workout isn't stopped)
* Relevant features are modified to better understanding. 
* An interactive dashboard has been created to understand the trends in my workout sessions better.
